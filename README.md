# Climate-Friendly Food Sustainability Labeling Project 2023-2024

The Climate-Friendly Food Sustainability (CFFS) labelling is carried out on four sites, three of which are for UBC Food Services and the last one for AMS. 
- UBCFS: Open Kitchen, Gather, Feast
- AMS: Flavour Lab

Although the labelling process is similar between UBCFS and AMS, there are some differences due to different input sources. The detailed explanation for UBCFS and AMS are written in their respective folders. All data can be found under **data** folder. 

Instructions for running the analysis processes:
1. To complete analysis for UBC Food Services Products navigate to the **UBCFS/RECIPE_PROCESSES_2023_2024** directory where you will see 5 files that each complete one step of the analysis proceedure. More information on the particular inputs and files required are provided as comments in all code cells.
2. To complete anaylsis for UBC AMS navigate to the **AMS_2023_2024_Current_Version/RECIPE_PROCESSES_2023_2024** directory where you will see 5 files that each complete one step of the analysis proceedure. More information on the particular inputs and files required are provided as comments in all code cells.
